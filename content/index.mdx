# Introduction
I am primarily a Java developer but also have skills as a full-stack developer. This site serves as a central repository for my technical notes and documentation. It is a "living document" and continuously under construction.

## About this site
This site was built using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/docs). It is deployed to Vercel via [my github repository](https://github.com/Lawrence-M-Reynolds/LawrenceReynoldsTechNotes/tree/main).
