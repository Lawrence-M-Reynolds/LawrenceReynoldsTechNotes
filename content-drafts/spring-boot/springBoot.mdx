## @SpringBootApplication
Shortcut annotation that groups several other annotations, including:
@EnableAutoConfiguration finds classes within the project, and dependencies, annotated with @Configuration.

## @ConditionalOnClass
The bean annotated will only be created if a given class is on the classpath.

## @Controller, @Service, @Repository
The web, business logic, and data layers.

# Dependencies
Starter dependencies are descriptrs for 
## spring-boot-starter-web
Tools to build a web application. This contains the embedded tomcat server.

If you see the gradle definitition it depends on: org.apache.tomcat
This provides the embedded tomcat.

This depends on both spring-boot-starter-tomcat and spring-boot-starter

ServletWebServerFactoryConfiguration is part of the autoconfiguration mechanism for the embedded webserver, this maybe tomcat, jetty etc. This is important for the defining and customising the websererver behaviour. It makes use of @ConditionalOnClass.

So if the EmbeddedTomcat library is present (tomcat-embed-core) then TomcatServletWebServerFactory is loaded into the context.
This same mechanism is used for other purposes, eg databases.

### spring-boot-starter-tomcat
Provides beans and functionality for tomcat.

### spring-boot-starter

Launches a spring context.
Contains many classes annotated with @Configuration.
Classes to configure variuos components - databases, webserverss, brokers etc.

### spring-boot-starter-json
Alllows conversion of beans to json and vice versa.

### spring-web / spring-webmvc
These are the frameworks used to create the apis.
